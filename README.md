### Hej, my name is Flo. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineering Professional with over a decade of industry experience.

Currently, I am working as an Engineering Manager at [Tonies](https://tonies.com/de-de/).

I strongly believe in providing teams with the autonomy to be self-sufficient and in control of their own growth and trajectory.

There is a quote that I like:

#### Things I dislike

- unprepared, bad meetings without a clear goal
- premature abstractions
  - generalisation leads to tighter coupling
- arguing for the sake of it, stubborness
- technological bias
  - I generally believe there are always multiple tools to get the job done. It varies from team to team which one is the right one.
