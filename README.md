### Hej, my name is Flo. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineering Professional with over a decade of industry experience. <br>
Currently, I am working as an Engineering Manager at [Tonies](https://tonies.com/de-de/).

I strongly believe in providing teams with the autonomy to be self-sufficient and in control of their own growth and trajectory.


Apart from that, the quote about software engineering I like most is:

> Code gets read far more often than it gets written.
>
> _probably by Robert C. Martin_


#### How I interpret my role

- fostering an environment in which __everyone__ can feel safe, supported, and heard
  - I will have your back, always!
- making sure everyone is on the same page about the current tasks
- my job is not to make sure you do your job, but to ensure you are enabled to do it

___

#### Things I value and believe in

- honesty and openness
- trust
- iteration over planning
  - to some extend
- ["People over processes"](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
- [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
- positive/open error culture

___

#### Things I dislike

- unprepared, bad meetings without a clear goal
- premature abstractions
  - generalisation leads to tighter coupling
- arguing for the sake of it, stubborness
- technological bias
  - I generally believe there are always multiple tools to get the job done. It varies from team to team which one is the right one.
